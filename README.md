# Oodle Bindings for C#

## What is Oodle?

Oodle is a compression algorithm owned by EPIC Games. It is used to compress and decompress game files in numerous games. Meaning, if you want to edit a game's files, you need a compressor to write to it.

## What can you do with this repository?

With this repository, you can use Oodle in your own C# projects. This includes Compression and Decompression support useful for storing lots of data, or as previously stated, writing to a game's files which uses Oodle.

Few things to note:
- If you would like to use this in your own project, please give credit.
- If you don't know how to make a compressor with it, use a pre-compiled version in the releases tab.
- This uses Oodle 2.5, if you want it to work on a newer version, either rename the dll to 'oo2core_5_win64.dll' or change the name in the 'Imports.cs' class.
- I WILL NOT BE PROVIDING AN OODLE DLL DUE TO LEGAL REASONS!!!
