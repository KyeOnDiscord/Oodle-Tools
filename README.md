# Oodle Compressor Made In C#

# DOES NOT HAVE DECOMPRESSION SUPPORT

Few things to note:
- If you would like to make a change or add something to this, make a pull request.
- If you would like to use this in your own project, please give credit.
- If you don't know how to compile it, use a pre-compiled version in the releases tab.
- This does use Oodle 2.5, if you want it to work on a newer version, either rename the dll to 'oo2core_5_win64.dll' or change the name in the 'OodleStream' class.
- I WILL NOT BE PROVIDING AN OODLE DLL DUE TO LEGAL REASONS!!!
